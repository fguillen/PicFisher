# Getsafe Backend Coding Challenge

## Task context
Imagine you are employed at a hypothetical company called ‚ÄúThe Big Picture Corp‚Äù where the product department is requesting a tool to download a list of images from a plain text file. For now there are not many requirements from product yet and you only know that they want a simple command line tool for downloading images from a list of urls and storing them on the local harddrive. From the product vision however, it‚Äôs already clear that having the functionality of batch downloading images will be important to the product and is likely to be used in several different contexts.

## Assignment
Implement the functionality of downloading images from a given plain text file. Document your solution in this github repository and quickly explain why you think this is a good solution to the given task.

## Some things to keep in mind
- We prefer if you use Ruby, but we‚Äôre ok if you use a different language
- You can assume that the image urls in a given file are separated by whitespace and can potentially include invalid urls
- Your code should be executable through a command line interface (script, rake task, ...)
- You can assume your code will be used in production and will also be further developed by other developers over time - therefore make decision accordingly
- Try to keep your commits history well organised and clean, like you would do in a pull request for a real task assignment.

## What we pay attention to
1. Does your solution work?
2. Is the code clear and maintainable?
3. Is the code tested?
4. Is your solution documented?
5. Have all instructions been followed?

Bonus: Document your thought process.

We're here for you in case you have any questions!

## Above all: have fun!‚úåüèª
